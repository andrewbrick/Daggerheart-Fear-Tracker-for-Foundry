# Daggerheart-Fear-Tracker-for-Foundry
A simple overlay that tracks GM fear tokens for the Daggerheart game system. Players and GM see a slider bar with tokens. GM can move tokens left (inactive) or right (active) when they gain and use fear. GM can make the bar invisible for everyone. Selectable max number of fear tokens.

Plan to have additional themes (images) at some point, but for now, custom images can be used for the slider bar and tokens via the module's settings.

Issues:
- None at this time

It's my first module. I'm trying. Help appreciated. :)

Feature Roadmap:
- windowed mini version
- number-only version
- custom nudging of slider bar's vertical position
- retain current number of fear tokens when changing max number of tokens
- player-controlled settings:
  - top/bottom display
  - choose: normal, windowed mini version, number-only version
- additional themes
- cooler animations?
