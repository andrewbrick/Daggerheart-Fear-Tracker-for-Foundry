# Daggerheart-Fear-Tracker-for-Foundry
A simple overlay that tracks GM fear tokens for the Daggerheart game system. Players and GM see a slider bar with tokens. GM can move tokens left (inactive) or right (active) when they gain and use fear. GM can make the bar invisible for everyone. The following things are customizable:
- use standard (large) or mini tracker (client scope)
- for the mini tracker:
-- character used for the pip (client scope)
-- colors used for active/inactive tokens (client scope)
- set max number of fear tokens (GM only)
- images used for standard version slider bar and tokens (GM only)

Plan to have additional themes (images) at some point, but for now, custom images can be used for the slider bar and tokens via the module's settings.

Issues:
- [here they are](https://github.com/andrewbrick/Daggerheart-Fear-Tracker-for-Foundry/issues)

It's my first module. I'm trying. Help appreciated. :)

Feature Roadmap:
- number-only version
- additional themes
- cooler animations?
