# Daggerheart-Fear-Tracker-for-Foundry
A simple overlay that tracks GM fear tokens for the Daggerheart game system

Issues:
- [s]This thing does not yet update on the client (player) side.[/s]
- Visibility toggle does nothing on the client side.
- I want to get rid of the + and - buttons on the client side (easy).
- Probably some issues with images being in the right location / script references to them.

It's my first module. I'm trying. Help appreciated. :)
